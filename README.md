# galois-field
A class for representing and manipulating Galois Fields (of prime order so far).

The purpose of this project is to be a support class for manipulating codes for error correcting codes over finite fields.

## Install

Just do make to get the object file.
The recommended use however is to take the source and use it like a library in other programs.


You can do make test to get a brief description of the class.

Modify the test.cpp file to play around, it alrady has some explanation of the functions but feel free to change it.
